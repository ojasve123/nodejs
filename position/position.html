<p>Another dominating performance and another series win for India at home. On the other hand, not a great series for Windies. They were better in Hyderabad than the first Test but still miles behind Virat Kohli and Co. 

    The five-match ODI series between the two nations starts from October 21 at Guwahati. We will be back on the same date with live scores and over-by-over updates. Till then, take care and goodbye.

    Virat Kohli, Indian captain: We didn't expect that in the morning to be honest. I think West Indies played really well to put us in that situation. With the ball, we were clinical. We just needed to step up with the intensity. The guys stepped up really well. Finishing inside three days was never on our mind. We were better today, and throughout the course of the Test match. If you look at the three guys that have come through, they have grabbed their opportunities really well. In this Test match, I want to single out Umesh. Picking 10 matches in a Test matches by a fast bowler is an outstanding achievement. I am especially delighted to see how he stepped up in the absence of Shami and Shardul. It's a great luxury to have, and we have a problem of plenty to be honest. We had a headache to choose out of some many good bowlers. I'm really happy to see these guys fit, hungry. We want to take this forward, and bat well away from India as well. This game was tougher compared to the last one. Partnership between Rishabh and Ajinkya was heartening to see. That 146-run partnership is something that we want to see more often. I want to thank the crowd as well. They were outstanding.

    Shaw: It was a happy moment for me, finishing a game for India. It's a moment of pride. My first international series and winning it 2-0 with a Man of the Series award is a great feeling. Everyone is like a family now, it's not like a junior and senior situation anymore. I don't know what's happening next, I'm just enjoying this moment.

    Umesh Yadav, Player of the Match: First of all I would like to tank my teammates for their support. I knew that I was the only fast bowler playing and felt that I had a good chance. I just kept going for wickets and kept trying my best. We are enjoying each other's company; it is very healthy competition and keep playing for each other and for the team.

    Jason Holder, West Indies captain: After the first Test, we were struggling early on. Put ourselves in a good position. India are obviously better than us. Seamers got wickets, Umesh got 10 wickets, I got five. In hindsight, you can say we could've gone with an extra seamer. We need to apply ourselves a little more. Think I'm playing pretty good cricket. Just a matter of keeping it going. I love playing Test cricket, and it is my favourite format.

    Was quite a teaser in the end that one, but on a day where sixteen wickets fell, hosts, India won the second Test in the 92nd over of the third day with all 10 wickets intact, taking the series 2-0.
    
    Umesh Yadav headlines the second Test with a stellar show with the ball claiming his maiden 10-wicket haul in Tests.
    
    Vital knocks from Shaw, Rahane and Rishabh in the first innings.
    
    From the Windies Chase and Holder did try their best and make things as competitive as they could, but the World No 1 side was way too strong as they complete the two match Test series that took a total of six playing days.

    Ravi Shastri, Indian coach: Lot of positives. What we said, when we play at home, its easy to get carried away. We wanted to develop on good habits. You get a partnership, make sure its a big one. I think the boys really stood up to this Test. I felt really happy for him. It can be frustrating for Umesh when you have to sit on the bench. He got his opportunity here, and he grabbed it with both hands. What this will do is it will make him believe that he belongs to the best XI India can put out. What I liked was his consistency in this game. He's born to play cricket. When I saw him in England, you can see the number of years he's put into cricket. When you look at his game, he's a spectator's delight. Reminded me a bit of Sachin, a bit of Viru. And when he walks, there's a bit of Lara there. I think he has a bright future. I think he'll be fine. I sometimes think he tries too hard. He's a world-class player and works really hard at his game. Pant, big improvement in his keeping and with the bat as well.

    "It's been a good experience for me playing Test cricket. I always wanted to play Test cricket. It's been a good experience. Everyone's helping me to grow, wicket-keeping, batting everything. (On missing out on tons) I think about, but only a little. Need to grow as a cricket. (On his goals) Just playing my normal game and do good in one-days," says Rishabh Pant, who scored 92 at Hyderabad, to Manjrekar.

    "It was good fun batting with him (Rishabh Pant). We were trying to build a partnership. He batted really well. I wanted to bat long and this innings has really helped me a lot. You can develop some bad habits but I wanted to bat long and correct those habits. We played very well throughout the series, In Rajkot, we batted really well but here, credit to Umesh Yadav. Even in the absence of one bowler, he bowled really well," says Ajinkya Rahane to Sanjay Manjrekar.

    Play likely to extend past five. Will be surprised if Holder isn’t pulled up for slow over rate. Yes lots of wickets fell today but with five minutes to five, which is the added 30 mins of play, and still five overs are remaining in the day’s play.</p>
